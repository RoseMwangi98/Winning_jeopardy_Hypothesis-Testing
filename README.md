# Winning_jeopardy_Hypothesis-Testing
Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for many years, and is a major force in popular culture.

Imagine that you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any way to win. In this project, you'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win.

The dataset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions.

As you can see, each row in the dataset represents a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy. Here are explanations of each column:

Show Number - the Jeopardy episode number
Air Date - the date the episode aired
Round - the round of Jeopardy
Category - the category of the question
Value - the number of dollars the correct answer is worth
Question - the text of the question
Answer - the text of the answer
